An animation of Snell's Law that was made using the `var_transition` function of mplanimations. A source of light passes through a material with a refractive index of 2 and the resulting refraction can be seen. The light then leaves the material and continues on parallel to but displaced from the original beam.

Also shown is the reflectivity and transmissivity; the alpha (transparency) of the lines is proportional to the values of reflectivity and transmissivity calculated from the Fresnel equations for polarization parallel to the plane of incidence. For clarity, the alpha of the reflected beam is set a twice the true value for the reflectivity, and the transmissivity is set as the true value (although it is a bit difficult to see that it does in fact fade). This reveals the Brewster angle because the reflected beam disappears at the Brewster angle, which for this case would be 63 degrees.
