# UncertaintyPrinciple
A simple animation that shows the origin of the infamous Uncertainty Principle.

The animation shows a single wave pulse on the top and the Fourier transform of that wave pulse below. When the wave pulse has a short width in space, it must be composed of a wider range of wavenumbers. This is a mathematical property of waves that gives rise to the Heisenberg Uncertaintly Principle in physics.

The interpretation of the x-axis is of course different for each curve; in the top one, it is to be interpreted as position, while in the bottom one the axis should be interpreted as the wave number k.
