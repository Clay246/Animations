# UncertaintyPrinciple
A simple animation that shows the origin of the infamous Uncertainty Principle.

The animation shows a single wave pulse on the top and the Fourier transform of that wave pulse below. When the wave pulse has a short width in space (or time), it must be composed of a wider range of wavenumbers (or frequencies). This is a mathematical property of waves that gives rise to the Heisenberg Uncertaintly Principle in physics.
